Test area for code to propagate 2-line element ephemeris data

See spacetrk.pdf for documentation, code and code test results.

Fortran code taken from CelesTrak www site:

2-line element (TLE) ephemeris data for Chandra and XMM
available at
http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/science.txt

foo.f is working code

the executable is "foo", which is compiled with
f77 foo.f -o foo

Sample inputs are in test.dat, which are the test cases
shown in the documentation in spacetrk.pdf
Only the models SGP, SGP4, SGP8 are working.
The models SDP4 and SDP8 do not work. I don't know why yet.
Also the results from SGP, SGP4 and SGP8 only agree with
the documented expected results to about 6 or 7 sig digits.
But since the documented results are from FORTRAN on an
old computer (pre-IEEE floating point?), and it's single
precision code, I'm not too worried.

IDL procedure compare.pro
does comparison plots between foo output (in fort.16)
and CXC predicted ephemeris PE.EPH.dat
Plots are shown in comp.ps
