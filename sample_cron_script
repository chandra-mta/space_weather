# NAME
#   sample_cron_script
# PURPOSE
#   A demo Korn shell script that will ftp to SEC's anonymous ftp
#   site and get some files. This routine would normally be 
#   invoked by the cron utility.

# Scripts invoked by the cron utility don't have much of a command
# search path, so its a good idea set it explicitly
PATH=/bin:/usr/ucb/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:

# The autoload command causes the script to load the ftp_get function
# so you don't have to copy it into every script that uses it.
autoload ftp_get

# You need to tell the autoload command where to search to find the
# ftp_get function, this assumes you have installed ftp_get in
# a directory called /usr/local/ksh
FPATH=/usr/local/ksh:

# You may want to keep an errlog in case something goes wrong...
errlog=/tmp/ftp_get_errlog.$$

# For example, call ftp_get to acquire the latest solar region summary.
# (The file will be placed in the default directory specified by ftp_get).
ftp_get /pub/latest/SRS.txt 2>$errlog
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  print -u2 "Error detected at `date -u`:"
  cat $errlog $1>2
else
  rm -f $errlog
