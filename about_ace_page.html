<h3>The Science Operations Team has two proton monitoring systems.</h3>
<ol>
<li> Orbit Monitor:<br>
  

The fluence of ACE protons in the 115-195 keV energy range is
integrated over each Chandra orbit, while Chandra is above 70,000 km 
geocentric distance. The fluence measurement is reset to 0 while
Chandra is below 70,000 km.
<p>
If the fluence exceeds a threshold, SOT and FOT members are alerted 
via pagers and via email. The alert message provides the measured
fluence and the integrated time.
<p>
The latest ACE proton flux, and the integrated fluence, are on the
top line of the 
 Chandra snapshot </a>display (f_ACE and F_CRM respectively),
and on the SOT's  <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/mta/ace.html">
ACE page</a>.
<p>
	
<!---  Regarding EPHIN data,  our  P4GM channel  threshold in these OBC units is 118.08 cts/sample.
The E1300 threshold is 1318.56 cts/sample and the P41GM trigger is 100
cts/sample FYI. --> 

<p>
ACE proton energy range: 130 - 214 keV
<p>
An open-ended series of thresholds,
at 1E9, 3E9, 9E9, 27E9, 81E9, 243E9 etc.
For each threshold, issue 3 alerts at 30 minute intervals,
then increase threshold to next level.
Reset orbit fluence to zero, and reset threshold to 1E9 
at the end of each orbit.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Alert list:  
<ul>
<li> sot_red_alert
</ul>
</ul>

Details of operation: see /proj/rac/ops/ACE/README on the HEAD LAN.
<HR>
<li> Two Hour Monitor:
<h4><font color=FF0000> A violation of this limit is more serious than the orbital limit
since it implies a similar flux in a shorter time scale.</h4> </font>
<p>

The fluence of ACE protons in the 115-195 keV energy range is
integrated as a runing average over each 2 hour period.
This is 24 measurments during each period.  Bad measurments are
dropped and the average Flux particles/cm2-s-ster-MeV is calculated.
<p>
If the fluence exceeds a threshold, SOT and FOT members are alerted 
via pagers and via email. The alert message provides the measured
fluence and the integrated time.
<p>
ACE proton energy range: 130 - 214 keV
<p>
Fluence threshold = 50,000 protons/cm2-s-ster-MeV average over a 2
hour window (3.6e8 protons/cm2-ster-MeV).
<br><br>
An ACE instrument swap occurred in February 2004.  The FP6p (761-1220 keV)
channel stayed the same but the P3 channel (112-187 keV) changed somewhat.  
Therefore we now alert first if the fluence derived from FP6p*36.0 
is greater than 1.2e8 p/cm2-ster-MeV.  An alert is also sent if the new
P3 channel (115-195 keV) exceeds 3.6e8 p/cm2-ster-MeV and P3/FP6f < 36.

<ul>
<li>Alert list:  
<ul>
<li> sot_red_alert
</ul>

</ul> 
Alert scheme: 1 alert. Once this alert
triggers it is disabled for 24-48 hours or until manually rearmed by the 
MTA scientist.<br>

<hr>
<li> Kp Monitor:
<h4><font color=FF0000> A violation of this limit indicate the general
radiation state near the Earth is high.</h4> </font>
<p>

If the  value of Kp (projected) exceeds the threshold a
yellow alert is generated, SOT and FOT members are alerted 
via email and pager. The alert message provides the measured
Kp, current S/C configuration and comm schedule.   The threshold is
variable on a matrix of time (by month) and configuration (grating and sim 
position).
<p>

<ul>
<li>Alert list:  sot_yellow_alert
</ul> 

Alert scheme: 1 alerts,  Once this alert
triggers it is disabled in 24 hours.<br>

<p>
The latest ACE proton flux, the integrated fluence, and Kp are on the
top line of the  
 <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/mta/Snapshot/snap.cgi?action=Latest">
 Chandra snapshot </a> display (f_ACE, F_CRM and Kp respectively),
and on the SOT's  <a href="http://asc.harvard.edu/mta/ace.html">
ACE page</a>.

<li><a name="RADMON"> Chandra RADMON trigger levels</a>
<p>

RADMON will trigger SCS 107 (SI safing) if ANY of the following three 
EPHIN channels exceeds the on-board threshold for 10 consecutive samples.
EPHIN samples are sent to the OBC each 65.6 seconds.
<pre>
AS OF DEC 09, 2008:

- No discrimination among electrons, protons, and nuclei will be made
  - All four proton channels will show 0 counts
  - All four electron channels will become combinations of electrons, protons 
    and nuclei (e.g. the new E150 will be E150 + P4GM + H4GM)
- The overall geometric factor will be change but will be constant (i.e. it 
   will not toggle between large and small)
- The safing channels will be E150, E1300, HRC MCP Total Rate with the 
  following thresholds:

E150      800000 counts/sample
E1300       1000 counts/sample
MCP Total     30 counts/sample (the relevant MSID is 2DETART)


The previous thresholds (now obsolete) were:
                                                   THRESHOLDS

                                    -------------  ----------   ----------
E1300 (electrons, 2.64 - 6.18 MeV):      10.0        1318.56        78.72
P4GM (protons, 5.0 - 8.3 MeV):          300.0         3542.4       3542.4
P41GM (protons, 41 - 53 MeV):            8.47          100.0        100.0
