
Here is a simple approach to get files via ftp. It works well
from a PC as well as unix, or other, machine.


Create a file named "ftp.txt" with the following (be sure to
put YOUR email address in the user line!). This example gets
the most recent Solar Region Summary and Solar Geophysical
Activity Summary from the /latest directory:
 
    open ftp.sec.noaa.gov
    user ftp vraben@sec.noaa.gov
    cd pub/latest
    get srs.txt regions.noa
    get sgas.txt activity.noa
    bye
 

Create an command script file with the following line:
 
    ftp -n < ftp.txt
 

When you execute the command script file the regions.noa
and activity.noa files will be written.
