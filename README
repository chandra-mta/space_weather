This directory contains several example Korn shell scripts
to demonstrate how to automatically retrieve files
from SEC's anonymous ftp server.

The sample_cron_script script is invoked by the Unix "cron"
utility. It passes names of files to the function "ftp_get"
which builds a file of ftp commands and then invokes ftp.

The test_ftp_get may be used to manually test the ftp_get function.

The specifics of how you set up cron will vary, depending upon
the operating system you are using. 

   HPUX Example:

   You need to create a file (let's call it schedule) to be used by cron
   to automatically call this script at a specified time.
  
   The first five fields of each entry in the schedule contain integer patterns 
   that specify the time and date in the following format:
            Minute (0-59)
            Hour (0-23, UT time)
            Day of the month (1-31)
            Month of the year (1-12)
            Day of the week (1-7, 1 is Monday)
  
   Each of these patterns may contain
       o A number in the range above
       o Two numbers separated by a minus sign, indicating an inclusive range
       o A list of numbers separated by commas, meaning any of the numbers
       o An asterisk, meaning all legal values for that field.

  
   The following is a sample entry in the schedule to transfer the
   solar region summary report at 1:48 a.m.  each day. 

    48  01  *   *  *  /usr/local/ksh/sample_ftp_get.ksh

   Then submit the schedule to the crontab utility as follows:
       crontab schedule
  
   If the crontab does not permit you to submit the schedule, the sysadmin for your
   machine must add your username to the file /usr/lib/cron/cron.allow
   Also, the cron uses the default timezone for your particular machine, usually
   EDT. 
   
   DEC5000 Example:

   The field format is identical to the HPUX example. However, there is no crontab
   command. The entries are made directly in the file: /usr/lib/crontab
   Be careful though, the script run as the superuser, root, so bad things 
   can happen if something isn't mounted. The sample scripts here are pretty 
   paranoid about checking for such things -- but there are no guarantees!
